        <p>
          Being a full time student, and having a part time job does not give
          you very much free time. However, when I am able to sit down and enjoy
          some free time, gaming is my favorite hobby. I can spend hours on my
          favorite FPS without getting bored.

          <h2>Valorant</h2>
          <p>
            Valorant is my favorite FPS of all time! I have quite a few hours
            played in this game, and in my peek I was Immortal rank. My favorite
            agent is Jett because she is an aggresive character and it leads to
            the most fun.

          <h2>Overwatch</h2>
          <p>
            I did not start playing Overwatch until Overwatch 2 came out but I
            had instant regret about not having played it earlier.
            Unfortunately, after quite a few hours into the game I started to
            realize why the game was so hated. I still hop on the game from time
            to time as it is one of the best paced FPS ever made.
