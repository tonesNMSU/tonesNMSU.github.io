        <h1>PC Building</h1>
        <p>
          PC building and tinkering has been one of my favorite hobbies for a
          long time. I have helped a few friends and family members build their
          own custom rigs over the last few years. Building something from
          scratch is one of the most satisfying projects you can take on. There
          are sometimes hiccups and issues that you face throughout the process
          but that only makes it more satisfying when you complete the project.
